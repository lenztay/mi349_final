        <article class="about-post">
            <h3>My name is Taylor Lenz, the CEO of Pressed Nails</h3>
            <p> During the COVID-19 pandemic, I found that it was hard to take care of yourself and do the things you usually enjoy. For me, that would be doing my nails! I created <strong>Pressed</strong> to 
                provide a safe, more personable, and cheaper experience to doing nails at home! These nails are designed to meet the newest style criteria and meet the 
                needs of people with all different nail sizes. I want to thank your for supporting the Pressed Nails team!
